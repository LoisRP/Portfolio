# Portfolio
Limited collection of items I have authored related to technical communication and programming. No items from full-time employment between 2006-2017, due to NDAs. 

## Articles
Past contributor to TECHWHIRL, a technical communication portal. See my articles there:

I am listing links to books that I have authored that are available on Amazon, but I have also written a couple others.

## Documentation samples (at Google Cloud, December 2020-January 2023)

I created and maintained documentation for these products. Contact me for precise contributions, as most of this work involved a team effort.

## Documentation samples (at Amazon Alexa, January 2017-November 2019)

I have worked on many of the topics available in the [Alexa Skills Kit developer docs](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/ask-overviews/build-skills-with-the-alexa-skills-kit.html). In addition, I have worked on other topics for a limited audience. 

## Documentation samples (pre-2006)
I cannot include links to any documentation done at my employment from 2006-2017 because of NDAs. However, I have older documents available in a [zip file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByL12B5mpwZzclN2ZjA1X3ZJbmc/view?usp=sharing).

## Code samples
I cannot include any from work, but I include a few code samples from courses and that I have done for fun.
