# Portfolio
Limited collection of items I have authored related to technical communication and programming. No items from full-time employment between 2006-2017, due to NDAs.

## Documentation samples (at Amazon Alexa, 2017-present)

I have worked on many of the topics available from [Alexa Skills Kit developer docs](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/ask-overviews/build-skills-with-the-alexa-skills-kit.html). In addition, I have worked on other topics for a limited audience.  

## Documentation samples (pre-2006)
I cannot include links to any documentation done at my employment since 2006. However, I have older documents available in a [zip file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByL12B5mpwZzclN2ZjA1X3ZJbmc/view?usp=sharing).

## Code samples
I cannot include any from work, but I include a few code samples from courses and that I have done for fun.
